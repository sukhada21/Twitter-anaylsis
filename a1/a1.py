# # CS579: Assignment 1
#
# In this assignment, we'll implement community detection and link prediction algorithms using Facebook "like" data.
#
# The file `edges.txt.gz` indicates like relationships between facebook users. This was collected using snowball sampling: beginning with the user "Bill Gates", I crawled all the people he "likes", then, for each newly discovered user, I crawled all the people they liked.
#
# We'll cluster the resulting graph into communities, as well as recommend friends for Bill Gates.
#
# Complete the **15** methods below that are indicated by `TODO`. I've provided some sample output to help guide your implementation.


# You should not use any imports not listed here:
from collections import Counter, defaultdict, deque
import copy
from itertools import combinations
import math
import networkx as nx
import urllib.request

    Perform breadth-first search to compute the shortest paths from a root node to all
